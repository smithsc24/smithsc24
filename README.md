Hi, I’m @smithsc24

A Front End web developer exploring the world of GIS.

I am slowly updating my profile to act as a portfolio, hosting some of my programming projects and any maps I create as part of my education.

For now any repositories here are works in progress with some planned additions (primarily navigation).
